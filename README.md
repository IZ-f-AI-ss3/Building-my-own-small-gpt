# Building-my-own-small-gpt
Following the YouTube video by Andrej Karpathy https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU?feature=shared (one of my idols), I haven’t started this project yet, and I haven’t even created a script for it XD. However, sharing this will motivate me to dedicate at least two full days to it.

Based on the latest research, I plan to make further enhancements to the model. While I recognize that we currently lack sufficient data to fully evaluate its performance, the improvements I’m proposing are inspired by the findings discussed in the referenced article of Differential Transformer .
