# Building-my-own-small-gpt
Following the YouTube video by Andrej Karpathy https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU?feature=shared , I haven’t started this project yet . However, sharing this will motivate me to dedicate at least two full days to it.

Based on the latest research, I plan to make further enhancements to the model. While I recognize that we currently lack sufficient data to fully evaluate its performance, the improvements I’m proposing are inspired by the findings discussed in the referenced article of Differential Transformer .

All projects I can do with my current understanding :
Decoder prediction, Differential Transformer, Vision Transformer, Translation, matryoshka adaptor, small BERT model (with masking ... choose randomly what to mask) (I will finish all of theses  and then push them here )
